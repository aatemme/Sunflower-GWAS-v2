Software and datafiles needed in this folder for the GWAS pipeline

- The gemma software
- Plink software
- Genome anotation .gff3 file <- to find list of genes per genomic region
- Datafiles on the SNP set you'll use [snp set name] should be set in prefferences file as well.
	- [snp set name].bed
	- [snp set name].bim
	- [snp set name].blocks.det <-output from haplotype blocking from plink
	- [snp set name].cXX.txt <-output from gemma kinship matrix calculation
	- [snp set name].fam
	- [snp set name].map
	- [snp set name].PCA_EV <-file with population structure eigenvectors
	- [snp set name].tfam
	- [snp set name].tped

(The .bed/.bim and .tfam/tped are basically the same information so this list could certainly be optimized)

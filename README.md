# Sunflower-GWAS-2.0

This is a R only rewrite and extention of the GWAS pipeline initiated by Rishi Masalia.

Enchillada 2.0 adds:
- Streamlined folder structure of inputs/outputs/code/software
- GWAS calcuation using GEMMA
- Speedy drawing of Manhattan plots (grouped by trait with multiple environments per page)
- Colocalization visualization using haplotype blocks
- Gene list per haplotype block
- Drawing of manhattan plots with haplotype blocks overlay

UPDATE 2019/05/10: Works like a charm. Needs software data from separate location though

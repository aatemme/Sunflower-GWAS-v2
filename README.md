# Enchilada-GWAS-2.0
Version two of the Enchilada suite

This is a R only implementation and extention of the GWAS pipeline developed by Rishi Masalia.

Enchillada 2.0 adds:
- Streamlined folder structure of inputs/outputs/code/software
- Even quicker GWAS calculation using EMMAX
- Speedy drawing of Manhattan plots (grouped by trait with multiple environments per page)
- Colocalization visualization
- Identification of unique LD blocks

UPDATE 2019/03/14: Seems to stably work. Needs software data from separate location though
